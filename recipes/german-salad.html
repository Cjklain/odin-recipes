    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often
        bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if
        there are, they don't last long!</p>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place the potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10
            minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, turning as
            needed. Remove from the pan and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add onion to the bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until browned. Add the vinegar, water, sugar, salt
            and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and parsley. Crumble in half of the bacon.
            Heat through, then transfer to a serving dish. Crumble the remaining bacon over the top, and serve warm.
